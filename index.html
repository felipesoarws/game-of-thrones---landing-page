                    <p>Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B.
                        Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin’s series of
                        fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones.</p>
                    <p>The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It
                        premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73
                        episodes broadcast over eight seasons.</p>
                    <p>Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast
                        and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns
                        the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the
                        noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits
                        on it.</p>
                    <p>A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been
                        exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's
                        Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern
                        border.</p>

                <section class="scnd">
                    <p>Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international
                        fan base. Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and
                        production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence)
                        has been subject to criticism. </p>
                    <p>The final season received significant critical backlash for its reduced length and creative
                        decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime
                        Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018
                        and 2019.</p>
                    <p> Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a
                        Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series –
                        Drama. Many critics and publications have named the show as one of the best television series of
                        all time.</p>
                    <p>A prequel series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in 2022.</p>

                            <p>Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book
                                series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the
                                continent of Essos.</p>
                            <p>The series follows several simultaneous plot lines.The first story arc follows a war of
                                succession among competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven
                                Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The
                                second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles
                                the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce
                                peoples of the North.</p>
                            <p>Showrunner David Benioff jokingly suggested "The Sopranos in Middle-earth" as Game of
                                Thrones's tagline, referring to its intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy
                                setting of magic and dragons.</p>

                            <p>The former ruler of the Stormlands, Robert Baratheon, the usurper king
                                of the Seven Kingdoms, asks his old friend, the guardian of the North,
                                Eddard "Ned" Stark, to become his new right hand-the main adviser.
                                Ned Stark is confronted by Robert's wife, Queen Cersei, and her father,
                                guardian of the West Tywin Lannister.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the first season, the conflict between the Starks and the
                                Lannisters escalates, and after the death of Robert on the hunt and the
                                accession to the throne of Cersei's son, Prince Joffrey, Lord Eddard is
                                arrested and executed, and the internecine War of the Five Kings breaks
                                out in the state.

                                service of the Night's Watch fraternity guarding the titanic Ice Wall in
                                the far north of the Seven Kingdoms. A mysterious danger threatens the
                                watch and all of Westeros - the mythical White Walkers who live in the
                                lands beyond the Wall and command the army of the dead.

                                Westeros, Princess Daenerys Targaryen - a descendant of the house that
                                ruled in the Seven Kingdoms and destroyed by Robert Baratheon - is
                                forced by her brother to marry Khal Drogo, the leader of the Dothraki

                                little dragons, the only ones in the world.
